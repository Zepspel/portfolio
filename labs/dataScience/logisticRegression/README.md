# Logistic Regression in R

## 📌 Description
Logistic regression analysis on survey data to model the probability of a successful outcome.  
The assignment focuses on probability interpretation and validation of the property that total predicted probability equals the number of observed successes.

## 🧰 Tools
- R

## 🔍 What was done
- Imported and prepared survey data
- Encoded categorical price levels using dummy variables
- Built a logistic regression model
- Interpreted coefficients using odds ratios
- Computed predicted probabilities for all observations
- Verified the *probability mass equals counts* property
- Estimated success probability for a given customer profile

## 📊 Key Insight
Logistic regression produces well-calibrated probability estimates whose total mass matches observed outcomes, while odds ratios provide intuitive interpretation of feature impact.
