# Linear Regression Analysis in R

## 📌 Description
Linear regression analysis of U.S. household data to study how demographic factors influence income.  
Income is modeled on a logarithmic scale to handle skewness and outliers.

## 🧰 Tools
- R
- ggplot2

## 🔍 What was done
- Cleaned and filtered census-style household data
- Removed duplicates and outliers
- Applied log₁₀ transformation to household income
- Built and evaluated:
  - simple linear regression models
  - multiple linear regression model
- Interpreted statistical metrics:
  - t-values
  - R²
  - F-statistic
- Compared predicted vs. actual income values

## 📊 Key Insight
Education shows the strongest positive relationship with income, while a multiple regression model provides a significantly better fit than single-variable models.
