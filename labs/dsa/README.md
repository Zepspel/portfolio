# Data Structures & Algorithms in C

## 📌 Description
Collection of implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C.  
The folder contains labs covering matrices, queues, tables, trees, and graphs, along with reusable helper functions.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **Lab 1 – Matrices:** Implementation and operations on matrices  
- **Lab 2 – Queue:** Linear queue operations  
- **Lab 3a – Vector-based Table:** Dynamic table using a vector  
- **Lab 3b – Hash Table (Chaining):** Hash table with separate chaining  
- **Lab 4a – Binary Tree:** Basic binary tree operations  
- **Lab 4b – AVL Tree:** Self-balancing AVL tree implementation  
- **Lab 5 – Weighted Undirected Graph:** Graph representation and traversal  
- **Utils/Functions:** Common functions used across labs (e.g., input/output, memory management)

## 🧰 Tools
- C language  
- Standard libraries for dynamic memory and I/O  

## 📊 Key Insight
Each lab demonstrates core data structures, their operations, and efficiency considerations, forming a foundation for algorithmic problem solving.
